## Background

I've taken the freeertos example project from the pico-examples repo and focused on getting this built to establish the development environment for the projects going forward. 

Because of this, I've tried making the cmake build as generic as possible. Taking into account that the FREERTOS_KERNEL_PATH and PICO_SDK_PATH environment variables need to be set and building should succeed.
